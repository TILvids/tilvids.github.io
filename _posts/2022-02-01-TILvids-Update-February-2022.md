title: TILvids Update - February 2022
---

Welcome to February 2022, TILvids community! Let’s take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- First off, huge thank-you to our newest patrons, Nick T, Cypheon, and 1peter10! TILvids is completely community-funded, so becoming a patron means you are helping the community grow. Community donations go to expanding storage and other server resources, so that we can continue to add creators and share more content with the TILvids community. If you're interested in becoming a patron, [go here to learn more](https://www.patreon.com/tilvids)!

- We were joined by a number of new creators this month! [Simon Caine](https://tilvids.com/c/simon.caine_channel/videos) is bringing the TILvids community his unique blend of humor and tech commentary. [Jacob Westall](https://tilvids.com/c/jacob_westall_channel/videos) is showing off some neat DIY projects. And [Freedcreative](https://tilvids.com/c/freedcreative_channel) has a channel dedicated to all things [Krita](https://krita.org). We're excited and thankful to have our new creators sharing with the TILvids community. Welcome aboard!

- Congrats to Geotechland([@geotechland@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@geotechland)) on the success of his [latest video about Gnome 42](https://tilvids.com/w/2NQfnCZMnRQcUorE1v58ds), which shot up to well over 1,000 views! A great accomplishment indeed!

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of February 1st, 2022, we currently have 101,460 video views, 1350 users, and 188GB of local videos. It's worth keeping in mind that many instances don't clear out the spam accounts, but I do try to keep on top of that, which is deflating our total number of users (but is, in my mind, very much worth it).

Here are a few thoughts for February:

- Still waiting for [PeerTube 4.0](https://joinpeertube.org) to stabilize before updating the server, as there appear to be a few potential upgrade bugs still out there. The youtube-dl plugin is lately having a lot of trouble pulling in videos from creators' other channels, and 4.0 promises to address some of that.

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ❤️
