title: TILvids Update - October 2021
---

Welcome to October 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- We had a few new creators join us this month! [ArthurPizza](https://tilvids.com/c/arthurpizza/videos) has some great Linux and tech rants. [HappySquirrelBuilder](https://tilvids.com/c/happysquirrelbuilder_tech_channel/videos) shares information about how ransomware works. And finally, [LukeTech](https://tilvids.com/c/luketech_channel/videos) shares videos about Linux and single-board computers. Welcome to everyone, thanks for sharing your videos with the TILvids community!

- Next, a user-experience update. After some requests and discussion from our [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!kzdkMSDlVUjuTTObHw:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) / [Discord](https://discord.gg/bVzErWjvTS) chat, I tweaked the default landing page to have a new "Home" view (see image, below). This will hopefully expose new content being shared with the community better, as well as give coverage to our featured creators. Drop by our chat and let us know what you think!

- And finally, I updated the PeerTube software to version 3.3.0. I generally try to give new versions a couple of weeks to shake out the bugs, so look forward to 3.4.0 some time during October, probably. This will hopefully provide some new features for subscribing to individual creators on other instances.

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of September 1st, 2021, we currently have 88,630 video views, 1004 users, and 175GB of local videos. Congrats to the whole TILvids community on finally passing the 1,000 user milestone. On to the next 1,000!

Here are a few thoughts for October:

- As most of you know, I generally try to find a video to post as our "TILvids video of the day" to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/), [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/tilvids), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/web/@tilvids), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tilvids). This being October, be on the lookout for some Halloween-themed content to be shared there! And for you creators out in the community, if you have a "spooky" video coming out this month, make sure to give me a heads-up in the chat or on social media and let me know, so I can make sure to get your video into the mix!

- As always, more storage space and server resources means higher costs to run the site. If you're in the position to support, and want to help the TILvids community grow, please consider [donating to our Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tilvids). Every little bit helps keep us growing!

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ❤️
