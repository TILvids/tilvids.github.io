title: TILvids Update - September 2021
---

Welcome to September 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- Not a lot of big news for August, we're definitely in the lazy summer months! Since there isn't a lot of news, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that TILvids is completely funded via community donations. The more people we have donating, the more space I'm able to give to our creators to share their videos with the community. If you're in a position to donate, and would like to help, [you can do so here](https://www.patreon.com/tilvids). Thanks to everyone who is already contributing!

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of September 1st, 2021, we currently have 85,875 video views, 929 users, and 170GB of local videos.

Here are a few thoughts for September:

- I really want to try to find more creators to share with the TILvids community. When I first started the site, I spent a lot of time asking people if they'd be interested, and probably reached out to over 200 creators. That's something I haven't had as much time to do lately, but I want to get back to it. If you have any channels you regularly follow in the edutainment space, especially smaller channels (under 50,000 subscribers) please send them my way, or even better reach out to them and tell them you'd like to see their content available on TILvids!

- I'm looking to update the site software to v3.3.0 soon. I try to lag about a month or so behind the current version, just so any kinks can be worked out. Usually a pretty smooth process, but if there are any interruptions, that's probably why.

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ❤️
