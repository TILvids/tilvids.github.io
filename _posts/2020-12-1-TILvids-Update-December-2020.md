title: TILvids Update - December 2020
---

Welcome to December, [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! For those of you in the US, I hope you had as good of a Thanksgiving as this year could allow; for everyone else...I hope you're all just generally well! Let's take a look back at how things went during November, 2020:

- We had a number of new creators join us this month! Very happy to introduce [TooLateNate](https://tilvids.com/accounts/toolatenate), [ToggleJam](https://tilvids.com/accounts/togglejam), [PizzaLovingNerd](https://tilvids.com/accounts/pizzalovingnerdtilvids), [GeoTech Land](https://tilvids.com/accounts/geotechdigital), and [OmniTubers](https://tilvids.com/accounts/antikythera)! That's a huge group, and a bunch of great content to be shared with the TILvids community! A warm welcome to all of them!

- If you missed it, there was quite a big shakeup this month with [GitHub removing youtube-dl](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/github-agrees-riaa-claim-is-bunk-restores-popular-youtube-download-tool/) after a DMCA complaint by the RIAA, only to reinstate it a week or so later. I made [a video talking about the whole episode here](https://tilvids.com/videos/watch/59eec034-c8a1-401b-af68-cf593d4ee55a), so feel free to catch up if you missed it.

- [B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol), one of the devs over on [NewPipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewPipe/) contacted me to let me know TILvids has been added to the official instances list in the app! You can check out the PR for the merge [over here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4969). Thanks NewPipe, big fan of what you all are doing! Look for that in the 0.25.x update, coming soon.

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of December 1st, 2020, we currently have 40,018 video views, 331 users, and 98.2GB of local videos.

For December, I'm continuing to focus on a few things:

1. Getting more users onto [the TILvids sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids). It remains the best way to get TILvids to show up in front of people on a daily basis. I have been committed to posting a "TILvids video of the day" here (not hard to do, since we have so many new contributors!) and the posts show up on people's Reddit feed. If you want to help the community, probably the best way to do so is to mention TILvids on other subs and encourage people to check it out! We added something like 100 new subs in the last month, and that's 100 new people seeing TILvids content daily!

2. [Posting to Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@tilvids). As I said last month, this has been a wonderfully receptive community, and that continues to be true. I've actually started focusing less on Twitter and more on Mastodon recently, because the Mastodon community really gets what we're trying to do over here. Very supportive, and I like supporting Mastodon anyway.

3. Recruiting new creators. I'm constantly hunting around looking for smaller indie creators that would find a good home on TILvids, both because their content is a good fit, and because I think TILvids can be beneficial to helping them grow an audience. If you run into any creators that fit that description, feel free to send them over here!

I think that's it for now. I have talked to so many people over the past month that are supportive of what we're trying to do here, and you have no idea how much that means to me! I'm so happy to be able to build something that the community loves, that creators find useful, and that respects privacy all at the same time. For those that hang around in the Matrix chat, you know how much work this is for me, but it's incredibly gratifying work, and I'm greatly enjoying it.

Thanks for helping me build a great community here, let's keep it going!
