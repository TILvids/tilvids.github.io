title: TILvids Update - January 2022
---

Welcome to January 2022, TILvids community! Because this is the last post for 2021, and since I've had some requests for a video update in the past, I thought I'd take the opportunity to make a "Year in Review" video for the TILvids community. So without further ado, here is the TILvids 2021 Year in Review video!

<iframe width="560" height="315" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups" title="TILvids 2021 Year in Review" src="https://tilvids.com/videos/embed/02781a54-cc2a-4398-93b1-c0a35f6ee057?warningTitle=0&peertubeLink=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of January 1st, 2022, we currently have 96,702 video views, 1252 users, and 185GB of local videos. It's worth keeping in mind that many instances don't clear out the spam accounts, but I do try to keep on top of that, which is deflating our total number of users (but is, in my mind, very much worth it).

Here are a few thoughts for January:

- We had a huge influx of users, creators, and even donors after [this](https://twitter.com/Linux4Everyone/status/1471507890083024905) and a few other Twitter threads. We're so happy to see new folks discover our TILvids community, and you are all very much welcomed! I'll be introducing our new creators via our TILvids video of the day in the coming week!

- Looking forward to the 4.0 PeerTube update, which I'll hopefully be able to roll out this month. The youtube-dl plugin is lately having a lot of trouble pulling in videos from creators' other channels, and 4.0 promises to address some of that.

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ❤️
