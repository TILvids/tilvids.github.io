title: TILvids Update - March 2021
---

Welcome to March 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- A big TILvids welcome to new content contributor [Hot Chaklat Productions](https://tilvids.com/accounts/hotchaklat)! If you want to watch some interesting content ranging from electric vehicles to data privacy online, head on over and check them out!

- Our self-uploading crew continues to push out lots of great new content for the TILvids community! Thanks to [Vex0r](https://tilvids.com/accounts/vex0r), [PizzaLovingNerd](https://tilvids.com/accounts/pizzalovingnerdtilvids), [GeoTech](https://tilvids.com/accounts/geotechdigital), [Athena Productions](https://tilvids.com/accounts/athenaproductions), [The Attic Dwellers](https://tilvids.com/accounts/theatticdwellers), [Tyler's Tech](https://tilvids.com/accounts/tylerstech) and [the Pine64 Community](https://tilvids.com/accounts/pine64tilvids) for continuing to share their content!

- To celebrate the Mars Perseverance rover landing, a number of videos about the current and previous Mars missions were added to [the Open Space Vids channel](https://tilvids.com/accounts/openspacevids), including [this amazing video of the rover landing itself](https://tilvids.com/videos/watch/5211e86d-6421-442e-b1d8-d3e983ebd3b9)!

- No exclusive TILvids video content this month, unfortunately. With February being a short month, and just other things to focus on with the site, time ran out. Hopefully next month!

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of March 1st, 2021, we currently have 63,736 video views, 545 users, and 137GB of local videos.

For March, I'm continuing to focus on a few things:

- Looking for more creators. Trying to run TILvids is like trying to balance multiple spinning plates at once, with those plates being technically running the site, promoting the site to help grow the community, creating exclusive content, engaging with our community, and finding new creators. February was spent dealing with some technical issues and promoting, so I'm hoping to get back to reaching out to more creators this month.

- Speaking of content, I'd love to hear more from our community about what they'd like to see. We have a natural gravity around tech and open-source/web content, which is great and I love that content. But past that, I need to know what types of content creators I should be looking to bring in. If you have topic areas you'd like to see, post below in the comments and let me know!

- As always, please continue to spread the word online! Every month our community continues to grow, and this just makes it easier to convince new creators to give it a shot. If you want to see TILvids continue to get new creators, sharing the site is the best way to do it!

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community!
