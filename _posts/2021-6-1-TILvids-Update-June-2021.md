title: TILvids Update - June 2021
---

Welcome to June 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- A big TILvids welcome to our newest content creator, [Anthill Art](https://tilvids.com/accounts/anthillart/video-channels)! We've already seen a bunch of very cool videos about creating art using molten aluminum while removing invasive species. Check it out!

- As I mentioned in [last month's update](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/comments/n2m780/tilvids_update_may_2021/), I want TILvids to grow in scalable ways, and one of the mechanisms I hope to use is the "hub and spoke" model, where successful creators that fit into certain criteria can run their own instances and link back into TILvids via federation. I was happy to announce a few weeks ago we are running our first experimental trial under this model, and have [added Sun Knudsen](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/comments/n8i2bo/tilvids_announcement_of_the_day_creatorpartner/) as a creator-partner instance! Check his content out, either on TILvids or on [Sun's instance](https://peertube.sunknudsen.com) as he has some great privacy-related content!

- Mobile community members were disappointed a month or two ago to find out that NewPipe was no longer working with many PeerTube instances due to lacking support for HLS streaming. Happy to report that the latest release of NewPipe, version 0.21.3, has [fixed this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/comments/nmwz9v/psa_newpipe_release_v0213_available_fixes/)! So if you're a mobile community viewer, go grab the latest update and start watching again!

- As many of you know, I've struggled lately to find time to make my own content to share on the site. However, I [ran across](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/njva2s/i_released_my_first_godot_game_on_itchio/) a very cool indie game made with Godot, and being a fan of both indie gaming *and* Godot, I decided to make a short review of the game. Check out our exclusive [review of Starboy](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/comments/nkow88/tilvids_video_of_the_day_starboy_indie_game_made/), and if you think it looks like fun, consider paying $2 to [download Starboy from itch.io](https://mrkdji.itch.io/starboy)

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of April 1st, 2021, we currently have 77,514 video views, 751 users, and 156GB of local videos.

Here are a few thoughts for June:

- June might be a bit of a slower month for bigger undertakings, as I have some outside things taking up cycles. That said, I'm hoping to continue adding new creators to the community, and potentially expanding the "hub and spoke" model to any current creators interested in trying it out. Get in touch if you fall into either of those camps!

- We're starting to creep closer to the big 1,000 mark for users! As always, please continue to spread the word online! Every month our community continues to grow, and this just makes it easier to convince new creators to give it a shot. If you want to see TILvids continue to get new creators, sharing the site is the best way to do it!

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community!
