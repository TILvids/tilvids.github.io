title: TILvids Update - December 2021
---

Welcome to December 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- First off, Happy Thanksgiving to the TILvids community! Even if you aren't visiting from the United States, I hope you are able to stop every once in a while and think about the people and things in your life that bring you joy!

- Getting down to business, we were joined by an awesome new creator this month, [Video Game Animation Study](https://tilvids.com/a/danroot/video-channels)! Hosted by Dan Root, he is sharing some great break-downs of how animation is used in video games, especially retro-style games.

- Speaking of Dan Root, not only is he contributing his content, but he's also donating to our Patreon! We also are able to say thanks to Kuba, who joined us as a patron this month as well! Thank you all **so much** for your contributions. TILvids is a completely community-funded project, and the more donations we have, the more we can afford additional storage space for creators, processing to transcode video files, etc. If you are in a position to help and want to support TILvids, [consider donating](https://www.patreon.com/tilvids)!
 
- And finally, I updated the PeerTube software from 3.4.0 to version 3.4.1. No new features in this version, but some welcome bug fixes. For creators sharing on our community, the youtube-dl has been having some trouble lately, and is sometimes failing to pull in content. In looking at what's coming in PeerTube's 4.0.0 update, it looks like they're moving from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, a more regularly maintained script, so hopefully that will help smooth things out. ü§û

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of November 1st, 2021, we currently have 94,630 video views, 1184 users, and 182GB of local videos. It's worth keeping in mind that many instances don't clear out the spam accounts, but I do try to keep on top of that, which is deflating our total number of users (but is, in my mind, very much worth it).

Here are a few thoughts for December:

- Probably a bit slower this month from the admin side, as we have the holidays coming up, and things tend to get hectic in personal lives at that time. I still intend to post a TILvids video of the day though, and will hopefully find some holiday-themed content to brighten up everyone's lives!

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ‚ù§Ô∏è
