title: TILvids Update - November 2021
---

Welcome to November 2021, TILvids community! Let's take a look at what was happening at [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) over the last month:

- Happy Halloween! For those of you checking our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tilvids/), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/web/@tilvids), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tilvids) feeds, I post a TILvids video of the day on most days. To celebrate the Halloween spirit, I tried to highlight a number of "spooky" themed videos last month. Hopefully you enjoyed the festivities! üéÉ

- We were joined by an awesome new creator this month, [The 1920s Channel](https://tilvids.com/c/the1920schannel/videos)! They are going to be contributing some excellent content all about 1920s style, art, culture, and more. Welcome aboard, and thanks for sharing your videos with the TILvids community!

- We have two new patrons donating to support the TILvids community, Barry Solow and PublicLewdness! Also, a few regular patrons increased their monthly donation. Thank you all **so much** for your contributions. TILvids is a completely community-funded project, and the more donations we have, the more we can afford additional storage space for creators, processing to transcode video files, etc. If you are in a position to help and want to support TILvids, [consider donating](https://www.patreon.com/tilvids)!
 
- And finally, I updated the PeerTube software from 3.3.0 to version 3.4.0. There are some interesting new features in this update, especially relating to subscribing to individual creators on other instances, which is something the TILvids community has asked for. If you know of a creator on another instance that you would like to see as part of the TILvids stream, let us know on the [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!kzdkMSDlVUjuTTObHw:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/bVzErWjvTS) chat!

- I had a request to track some of the site stats. As of November 1st, 2021, we currently have 91,825 video views, 1075 users, and 179GB of local videos. It's worth keeping in mind that many instances don't clear out the spam accounts, but I do try to keep on top of that, which is deflating our total number of users (but is, in my mind, very much worth it).

Here are a few thoughts for November:

- We're now starting to have a number of regular content contributors to the site. You all ***rock***! Fresh content is what keeps TILvids interesting, and it's great to see all of your different videos! Please continue spreading the word to other creators and encourage them to consider sharing their edutainment content on TILvids. If you know someone who is interested in sharing, have them reach out on Mastodon, Twitter, Matrix, Discord, Reddit, [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/tilvids)...lots of great options!

I think that's it for now! Thanks so much to everyone for continuing to watch, comment, share, and support the [TILvids](https://tilvids.com) community! ‚ù§Ô∏è
